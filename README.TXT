Please run the main file: demo_nonlocal_split_bregman_flow.m using Matlab R2014b
You also can set different parameters by yourself in demo_nonlocal_split_bregman_flow.m
This version does not use Deepmatching to adapt large displacements, therefore it only used for accurate optical flow estimation with relatively small displacements.
£¨This version is optimized and converges faster than our method reported in our paper with a slight higer accuracy.£©
